# Paper Plane

Paper plane is a frontend-heavy webapp (hooray for [hoodie.js](http://hood.ie)!) that is developed to provide a feature-rich, easy and fun to use IDE for working with the awesome [paper.js](http://paperjs.org)-library.

## What's working

* Write code and have it rendered live in the background

## What's planned

* Save your sketches locally and publish them
* Browse published sketches
* Refine the user interface
