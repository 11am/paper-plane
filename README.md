# Creating a new Hoodie App

    # this will take a while
    $ brew install https://raw.github.com/janl/homebrew/1696ae6e52d4dc3f8d4c9967f037750e52de0d6d/Library/Formula/hoodie.rb
    $ hoodie new myappname
    $ cd myappname
    $ npm start
    # follow instructions, then open http://myappname.dev

Once your app is running, you can access your app's couch at `http://couch.myapp.dev`
and your app's admin backend at `http://admin.myapp.dev`
