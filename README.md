# Paper Plane

Paper plane is a frontend-heavy webapp (hooray for [hoodie.js](http://hood.ie)!)
that is developed to provide a feature-rich, easy and fun to use IDE for working
with the awesome [paper.js](http://paperjs.org)-library.

## What's working

* Write code and have it rendered live in the background

## What's planned

* Save your sketches locally and publish them
* Browse published sketches
* Refine the user interface

## Developing

It is assumed that you have some basic command line skills as well as `node` and
`npm` installed.
For browser-side package management `bower` is used and the backend is taken care
of by the hoodie (`npm install -g hoodie-cli`) framework. For running tests you
need to install grunt (`npm install -g grunt-cli`).

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install the dependencies and you're
ready to go!
