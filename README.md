# Creating a new Hoodie App

Wait! 

* Replace `myapp` with your desired appname (lowercase, letters only).

Now: move on.

    $ npm install -g local-tld
    $ git clone git@github.com:hoodiehq/my-first-hoodie.git myapp
    $ cd myapp
    $ Replace {{hoodie_appname}} with your appname in ./package.json
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Now you can go to `http://myapp.dev` to visit your app.

You also can your app's couch at `http://couch.myapp.dev`
and your app's admin backend at `http://admin.myapp.dev`
